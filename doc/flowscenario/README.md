# Flow Scenario
This section explain how to create a scenario to load a process.


## Goal
There is three goals:
* Create a lot of process instances, and see how your platform react. Does it handle the load?
* Generate a lot of process instances in one particular part of your process
* Generate a process instances and advance it at a specific part of the process

The last operation is very usefull for a developper. 
He wants to work on a particular task, but to arrive at this task, he has to execute user task or other service task. 
And some other service task are not developped, so he needs to simulate the execution.
